# Hello there! ðŸ¤Ÿ

This project is a blog created **to share my acquired knowledge with all of you**. It focuses on programming, mainly frontend and backend development, but in the future, it will also cover more "general" languages like Python.

## 1. ðŸ“‚ Project Description

Currently, the project is in the construction and development phase. Some features and functionalities are **still being tested and validated**. Therefore, the newsletter and commenting system are not yet operational.

The immediate plan is to update Next.js to version > 13.4 in order to utilize **the "App Router"**. Why? Because certain features I want to implement pose significant challenges with the "Pages Router" model. Transitioning to the new version will allow me to harness the new potential of Next.js while increasing the efficiency of my work and the implementation of new features.
